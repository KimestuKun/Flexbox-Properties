# Flexbox-Properties
Let's practice using different Flexbox properties! In this activity, you'll get to play around with justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction to move elements around.

Step 1: Open the coin collector Challenge Website:
  - Once again here is the link to the website: https://constructing-burgundy-fox-555.vscodeedu.app
  - The goal of the challenges is to line up the coins with Toad using Flexbox! The coins are in a Flexbox container so you just have to input CSS rules into the code box. For example, if we wanted the coins to move to the left side, we would just             + input:
            display: flex;
            justify-content: flex-start;
Step 2: There are 8 challenges in total. If you get stuck, play around with different Flexbox properties to visually see what happens with different properties. If you'd like to start over, you can refresh the page or empty the text box and hit the Apply button.
To acomplish this we use the following syntax:
  - justify-content: defines the alignment along the main axis of the flex container
  - align-items: defines how the flex items are laid out along the corss axis of the flex container
  - flex-direction: defines the direction the flex items are places in the flex container
